					ECDSA Node Project
Project Goal:
1. Incorporate Public Key Cryptography so transfers can only be completed with a valid signature

2. The person sending the transaction should have to verify that they own the private key corresponding to the address that is sending funds

My Modifictaion:

1. Added A New Component On The Client Side To Create Public & Private Keypair And Assoiate Some Fund To That Pair.

2. Added A New Path "/add" Path On The Server Side To Store Newly Created Public Key And The Fund Associate With That Key.

3. Modifiend The Transfer Component to Send The Transaction Request To The Server as Digital Signature.

4. Modified the Server Path "/send" That Able To signature and Verify The Signature To Release The Fund And Update The Both Sender And Receiver Account

Things To Be Considered While Using:

1. On The First Run The Server Don't Hold Any Account, So, To Check Functionalty On Must Create Cuople of Accounts Using Generate Key Pair Button

3. One Should Sign The Trasaction With Private That Has A Public On The Server Otherwise It will show An Alert "Malicious Activity", This Functionaly Works On Transfer Side.

2. Private Key Must be 32 Byts Hex String As It is Designed This Way. Other Wise it Will Not work

4. Any Invalid Public Address Will Not Only The Public Keys That Has Been Generated Through Generate Will Work. 

Note : Best Way To Check Usecases Save Write Down Keypairs Generated Through The Generate Kepairs The Use These Keypair To Check Fucntionalties.
